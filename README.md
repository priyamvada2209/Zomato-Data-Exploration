**Zomato Gold Data Exploration Using SQL**
This project explores user behavior and sales trends using SQL on a simulated Zomato-style dataset containing user signups, sales transactions, product details, and Gold membership enrollments. The analysis answers 12 business questions to uncover spending patterns, product popularity, user loyalty, and membership value.

Used advanced SQL window functions such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() for time-based analysis and ranking customer behavior.

Identified first/last purchases, repeat behavior, and spend timelines in relation to membership.

Implemented subqueries and CTEs for layered logic in answering complex business scenarios.
